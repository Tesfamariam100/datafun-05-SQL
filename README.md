# datafun-05-sql

## Project Setup Process

## Project Overview

This project aims to set up a development environment and repository for my DataFun 05 SQL project.

### 1. Create a GitHub project repository with a default README.md.

I create a new GitHub repository named datafun-05-sql. I include the default README.md and a .gitignore file for Python.

### 2. Clone your repo down to your machine. 

In my PowerShell terminal, I navigate to my Documents folder and clone the repository from GitHub.

### 3. Open your project folder in VS Code (if you haven't already).

Within the cloned repository folder, I create a new virtual environment named .venv.

### 4. Add a .gitignore with .vsode/ and .venv/ and whatever else doesn't need to go in the repo. 



### 5. Create and activate a local virtual environment in .venv.

I create and activate the virtual environment using PowerShell.

### 6. Install your dependencies into your .venv (pandas and pyarrow) and freeze into your requirements.txt. 

I install the pandas and pyarrow and generate a requirements.txt file by running pip freeze and redirecting the output.

### 7. Record the commands used in your README.md.

### 8. Git add and commit with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit") and push to GitHub.

I edit the README.md file to document the setup process using Markodown syntax

### 9. Create your first project files (usually in VS Code). 

I Create my first project files (in VS Code). 

### 10. As you work, git add / commit / push to GitHub.

I use the git add / commit / push to GitHub and verify that the README.md and requirements.txt files appear in my GitHub repository, datafun-05-sql.
